# Entity Visualizer

A tool for visualizing game entities on a 2D grid playfield and stepping through
their interactions.

This project is intended primarily as an educational tool. Its purpose is to
serve as a base onto which students will implement more complex functionality,
usually as part of an assignment. That way, students can focus on the data
structures/algorithms/logic required to make the game function without having to
worry about all the overhead of rendering a game.
