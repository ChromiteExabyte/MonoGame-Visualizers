# MonoGame Visualizations

This monorepo is a hub for several .NET projects built on top of MonoGame to
serve as visualization aids for teachers, students, and other learners.

The first round of these tools are being built mostly to service the Summer 2024
run of **COIS-2020H** at Trent University.
